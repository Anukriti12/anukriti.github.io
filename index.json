I am currently pursuing my undergraduate thesis at the MultiComp Lab in the Language Technologies Institute of Carnegie Mellon University, where I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Louis-Philippe Morency and mentored by Paul Pu Liang and Yiding Jiang. My thesis is focused on multimodal reinforcement learning, specifically exploring how language grounding can assist in capturing affordance of objects and accelerate learning of autonomous agents.\nI have also been collaborating with the Language Technology Lab, Universit√§t Hamburg recently, where I feel grateful to be working under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Chris Biemann on Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs. Previously, I have interned as a software engineer at Microsoft, Bangalore and worked on computer vision problems at MapmyIndia, Delhi.\nMy current research interests lie in deep learning and natural language processing. My brief experience with computer vision in the past sparked my interest in multimodal learning, the vibrant multi-disciplinary research field that focuses on integrating and modeling multiple communicative modalities, including linguistic, acoustic and visual messages. In the future, I aspire to work on seamless integration of modalities and build socially intelligent agents that can perceive, reason and act to assist people in interacting better with the world.\nI am searching for opportunities as a research assistant starting Fall 2021. If my research interests align with your work and you have a suitable position, please contact me.\nPersonal: My childhood fascination with space (still excites me) led me to joining Team Anant, a group of passionate undergraduate students building BITS Pilani\u0026rsquo;s first nanosatellite, where I was fortunate to work with some amazing people. I love running, playing basketball and am trying to find time to revisit my passion to write.\n","date":1571678002,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1571678002,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://jivatneet.github.io/author/jivat-neet-kaur/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/jivat-neet-kaur/","section":"authors","summary":"Hi!

Despite their strong performance on many sparse-reward tasks, existing curiosity approaches rely on a holistic view of state transitions and do not allow for a structured understanding of specific aspects of the environment. In this paper, we formulate curiosity based on grounded question answering by encouraging the agent to ask questions about the environment and be curious when the answers to their questions change. We show that language questions encourage the agent to uncover specific knowledge about their environment such as the physical properties of objects as well as their spatial relationships with other objects, which serve as valuable curiosity rewards to solve sparse-reward tasks more efficiently.","tags":[],"title":"Ask \u0026 Explore: Grounded Question Answering for Curiosity-driven exploration (ICLR 2021)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vishnu P Katkoori","Jivat Neet Kaur","Tushar Goyal"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1571678002,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571678002,"objectID":"ce6c6284310aae1e166ed8e168048f8c","permalink":"https://jivatneet.github.io/publication/bdot/","publishdate":"2020-12-06T22:43:22+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/bdot/","section":"publication","summary":"As a satellite is deployed from the launch vehicle, it is subjected to high angular rates which need to be dampened in order for the satellite to perform its functions as expected. Simple and robust algorithms, such as BDot, are generally used to provide the required control torque for detumbling the satellite. This paper elucidates the design process for the detumbling algorithm to be implemented on a nanosatellite currently being developed by Team Anant, the Student Satellite Team of BITS Pilani. The process commenced with the selection of hardware to be used onboard the satellite. Magnetometers and Gyroscopes were finalized to be used as sensors. Various commercially available sensor models were then compared based on power and operating conditions. For actuation, a magnetorquer system was designed specifically to the requirements of the team. The system comprised of two magnetorquer rods and a magnetorquer coil aligned in orthogonal directions. The sensors and actuators were then accurately modeled in MATLAB for further testing. The modeling involved some interesting challenges due to the magnetic moment retained by the ferromagnetic core. These challenges, and the ways to overcome them have been also been briefly discussed in the paper. After finalizing the hardware, the team proceeded with implementing various popular control algorithms for detumbling the satellite. The algorithms were first theoretically analysed, and then modeled on MATLAB. The simulations took the space environment around the satellite into consideration for higher accuracy. The algorithms were tested for different initial conditions, using different time-steps and under different power constraints. The algorithms considered and the conclusions derived from these simulations have also been discussed elaborately in this paper. The paper concluded by presenting the finalized detumbling algorithm(s) to be used by Team Anant, and the various conditions devised to ensure efficient use of electrical power. The paper also presents viable alternatives to the finalized algorithm(s), using other hardware components. These alternatives and conditions have also been documented in the paper for a better understanding.","tags":[],"title":"Simulation and Selection of Detumbling Algorithms for a 3U CubeSat (IAC 2019)","type":"publication"}]
